# Scrovol for GNOME Shell 3.28+

This is a very simple extension that modifies the panel button of the User Menu
to allow changing the volume by scrolling anywhere.

So for example, you can scroll over Night Light, WiFi, Volume, Battery or any
other icon in the system status tray to change the volume, instead of just the
Volume icon.
